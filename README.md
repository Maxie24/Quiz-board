### BDD
In order for the program to run well and to give the correct output, the code had to meet certain criteria
1. The user has to select one choice from the list provided.  
2. For the answer to be correct the value of the label has to be five.
Below is a table to describe this:

Behavior                |  Output Example
------------------------| ---------------
Five correct answers    | 100% "Good Work!! Keep It Up Smart Brain"
Four correct answers    | 80%  "Fair!! There is still room for improvement"
Three correct answers   | 60%  "This is below average but still not bad"
Two correct answers     | 40%  "Poor results!! Read extensively."
one  correct answer     | 20%  "Are you really a student here...
